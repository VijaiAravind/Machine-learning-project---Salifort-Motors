## **Project Ovverview**:
This project performs Data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualizations, Feature engineering and build predictive models that can provide insights to the HR Department of the company.Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

## **Objective**:
1. Empower the HR department with predictive insights to enhance employee satisfaction and reduce attrition rate.
2. Perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering to uncover key factors influencing employee turnover.
3. Build and compare multiple machine learning models — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest — to predict attrition.
4. Evaluate models using industry-standard metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC) for reliable performance assessment.
5. Final stage is to find out the best model to be predicted for future insights.

## **EDA and Data cleaning**:
1. Gather basic information about data and descriptive statistics.
2. Check for missing values and duplicates,there are 3008 rows are duplicated, this is 20% of data.
3. Check a box plot to visualize distribution of 'tenure' to detect outliers.
4. Understanding all the variables with the correlation between variables by displaying various charts.
